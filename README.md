## Setting up the project

You'll need `npm`, `bower`, and `gulp`.

From the google_places_api directory:

```
$ npm install -g gulp
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp
$ open index.html
```

If you'd like to avoid being asked for your location each time you visit the page, you can set up a simple HTTP server by running

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` 

in the google_places_api directory and visiting `localhost:8000/index.html`.
